Lindsay quickly converted Luke to being a fan of Austin. He loves eating Torchy’s tacos, reading, fitness and trying to keep up with their three daughters. Luke’s hope is that all sermons are accessible, interesting, and point towards the God who is with you and for you.	https://westover.wufoo.com/forms/x14uteda1pn1zaa/	unknown
